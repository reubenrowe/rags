# Parsing based on Recursive Adaptive Grammars

[Recursive adaptive grammars](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/rags.html)
are a powerful grammar formalism for declaratively
specifying arbitrary resursively enumerable languages.
They were developed by
  [John N. Shutt](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/)
as part of his
  [MSc Thesis](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~jshutt/thesis/top.html).

The code in this repository implements a parsing algorithm in Java.

The algorithm is documented in the HTML page contained in the `htdocs`
subdirectory.
At some point, I will translate this to markdown.
